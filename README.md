# Skin-Cancer-Kaggle-Project
This repository contains a skin cancer (Benign/Malignant) classification project as part of a Kaggle competition where our team placed 5th overall. This project was developed for my *Introduction to Statistical Models and Data Mining (Stats 101C)* course and focuses on applying statistical learning and machine learning methods to support early cancer detection.

## Methods
- Missing value imputation
- Exploratory data analysis (density plots)
- Feature selection (stepwise regression)
- Model training and fine-tuning

## Models Used in Final Analysis RMD file
- Logistic Regression (GLM)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Random Forest
- Ensemble models

## Other models tried but not in Final Analysis RMD
- XGboost
- Catboost
- GLMNET

## Files
- 📄 **Predicting Skin Cancer Final Paper (PDF)**
- 📊 **Final Presentation (PDF)**
- 💻 **R Markdown file** containing full analysis and code

## Results
Our final ensemble model achieved a final predictive performance of 0.60725 and ranked 5th in the Kaggle competition. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predicting-skin-cancer-status
